I'm an Australian Software Engineer currently travelling in the US and seeking new opportunities.

For the past 3 years I've been building a SaaS product from the ground up for the retail automotive industry. I'm interested in cloud computing, information security and distributed systems. I hold degrees in Software Engineering and Commerce.

Email me at tim @ thisdomain for my resume.
